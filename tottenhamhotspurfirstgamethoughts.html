                            <p>With matchday one in the books, I’ve got a few thoughts on my favorite team, Tottenham, and their draw against Leicester City.
                            </p>
                            <p>First off, as much as I love Sonny, I’m not convinced he’s the right fit for Ange Postecoglou’s system. Ange demands a lot from his wingers—they need to have the confidence to take players on and create chances from wide positions. Sonny just doesn’t seem comfortable out on the touchline, and honestly, I’ve always thought his best performances come when he’s running in behind or facing the goal. In Ange’s system, I think he’s better suited as a striker. His clinical finishing is exactly what Tottenham needs up front, and it feels like the best way to get the most out of him. A player of his caliber shouldn’t be forced into a role that doesn’t suit him. I’d rather see him with more creative freedom to help him regain his form. We all know Ange emphasizes passing, but there were definitely moments where I was yelling at the TV for Sonny to just take the shot.
                            </p>
                          <p>Brennan Johnson is another player who I think still has some work to do on the right wing. His pace is a great asset, but again he needs to build confidence to take on defenders more consistently. He also seems a bit wasteful in front of goal and struggles to deliver quality lifted crosses. There’s potential there, but it’s clear he needs more time to develop.
                          </p>
                          <p>As for Kulusevski, I was disappointed with his performance. Despite his limited minutes, he seemed too slow on the ball, often putting his head down and dribbling until he lost possession. He’s capable of so much more as we’ve seen in the past during the first half of last season, and I hope to see him step up in future games.
                          </p>
                          <p>On a positive note, Vicario continues to prove he’s a world-class keeper. He made several crucial saves that kept us in the match, and his passion for organizing the defense and keeping players accountable is exactly what we need. James Maddison also showed flashes of his creativity, which is encouraging to see after his injury. And Van de Ven was as solid as ever, using his incredible pace to keep our backline secure.
                          </p>
                          <p>Looking ahead, I’d love to see our attackers play with more confidence and get Solanke involved with dangerous crosses as his aerial presence is his strong suit. We need to be more clinical in front of goal and avoid overplaying in dangerous positions. There’s definitely potential in this squad, but we need to sharpen up if we want to compete at the highest level and push for Champions League football.  Again I understand football is a results based game and would love to see the under performers prove us all wrong. As always COYS.
