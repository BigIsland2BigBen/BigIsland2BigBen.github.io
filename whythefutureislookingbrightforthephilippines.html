                            <p>Here in the Philippines, we call our national football team the “Azkals.” In Tagalog, the word Azkal means "street dog," and to be completely honest, it is a name that perfectly encapsulates the Philippines men's national football team. On an international scale, they are ranked 141st, and in every sense, they are the street dogs of football, keeping themselves alive through sheer determination and willpower, feeding off the scraps others find no need for. Despite the lack of success in recent years and the slow growth of the sport in the Philippines, I believe that the future is bright for the Azkals.
                            </p>
                            <p>Due to the Philippines becoming a U.S. territory in the early 20th century after the Spanish-American War, there was ample American influence in the Philippines throughout the next upcoming decades.  In addition, the rise of basketball in the United States only meant that the Filipinos would also adopt it as their primary sport as well.  Now, despite the average height of a Filipino male being five feet and four inches, you can’t turn a street corner in the Philippines without seeing a basketball court full of players trying to run a pick up game.
                            </p>
                          <p>My recommended mode of transport is the London Tube, as Ubers and taxis can become costly on event days, and buses are inconsistent due to traffic and road closures. The station synonymous with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club (T.H.F.C.) is Seven Sisters. Seven Sisters is a Zone 3 station going northbound on the Victoria Line. You can transfer to the Victoria Line from Oxford Circus via the Central Line, Green Park via the Jubilee Line, Euston or Warren Street via the Northern Line, King's Cross St. Pancras via the Metropolitan and Piccadilly Lines, and Victoria via the Circle Line. Once you make it to Seven Sisters station, you can either take the Overground towards Cheshunt or Enfield Town to White Hart Lane station or do the iconic walk from Seven Sisters to the stadium. Personally, I recommend walking, but depending on the weather, the Overground is a fair option as well. The reason I prefer walking is that the Overground can become extremely crowded during event days, and on the walk, there is always the possibility to meet and talk to other passionate fans or get involved with pregame events outside the stadium.

                          <p>However, thanks to the growing popularity of football around Asia, you can slowly see a football culture rising from the heart of the Philippines. An example of this is when the entire country fully backed the women's national team when they made their first-ever appearance in a Women's FIFA World Cup one year ago in 2023.
                          </p>

                          <p>Some recent successes the Azkals have accomplished include semifinal appearances in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2018 in the AFF (ASEAN Football Federation) Championship, and qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time ever in 2019. Unfortunately, they have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, but I am confident that I will see it accomplished in my lifetime.
                          </p>

                          <p>One reason I believe that the Philippines has a bright future in football is because we have strong, balanced bodies that are naturally quick and agile. We also have naturally high endurance levels and are adaptable to humid conditions. It’s like our bodies are meant to play football. The reason I say this is because if you look back in FC Barcelona's archives, one of their first legendary players was a Filipino man named Paulino Alcántara Riestrá. He was a quick and technically gifted player who was actually the club's top scorer until Lionel Messi surpassed him in 2014. With Barca, he won 17 major titles, including five Spanish championships, 10 Catalan championships, and two Copa Del Reys. If that doesn’t prove that with the right training and focus on football, Filipinos like Paulino can become great players, nothing else will.

                          <p>Another reason I believe that the Philippines can become successful internationally is the modernization of their infrastructure, coaching staff, and the quality of training the future generations will receive. Recently, Filipino player Stephan Schröck created the Azkals Development Academy, with its sole purpose to find young talent and raise them through the ranks. This allows underprivileged people of the Philippines a chance to show off their talents and eventually represent the national team. In addition, players like Gerrit Holtmann, Neil Etheridge, and Bienvenido Marañón have had experience in big leagues like the Bundesliga and can use that to guide the up-and-coming youth.
                          </p>

                          <p>Overall, I believe that because of factors like the growing popularity of football in Asia and the Philippines, the body type that many Filipinos have, and the modern changes in infrastructure, coaching, and leadership, the Philippines can become a strong international team in the generations to come. It may take decades to catch up to the European giants or larger Asian teams like Japan or Korea, but I believe I will see the Philippines play in a FIFA World Cup one day.
