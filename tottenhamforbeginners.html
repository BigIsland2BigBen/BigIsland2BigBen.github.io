                            <p>Being a proud Spurs fan from Hawaii, it's been my dream to watch them play at White Hart Lane all my life. Recently, on matchday 37 of the 23/24 season, I made my dream come true and finally got to watch the Spurs go marching on against Burnley. If you are an international fan like me and visiting North London for the first time, here are some tips, tricks, and things you can expect when visiting the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on event days.
                            </p>
                            <p>Transport:
                            </p>
                          <p>My recommended mode of transport is the London Tube, as Ubers and taxis can become costly on event days, and buses are inconsistent due to traffic and road closures. The station synonymous with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club (T.H.F.C.) is Seven Sisters. Seven Sisters is a Zone 3 station going northbound on the Victoria Line. You can transfer to the Victoria Line from Oxford Circus via the Central Line, Green Park via the Jubilee Line, Euston or Warren Street via the Northern Line, King's Cross St. Pancras via the Metropolitan and Piccadilly Lines, and Victoria via the Circle Line. Once you make it to Seven Sisters station, you can either take the Overground towards Cheshunt or Enfield Town to White Hart Lane station or do the iconic walk from Seven Sisters to the stadium. Personally, I recommend walking, but depending on the weather, the Overground is a fair option as well. The reason I prefer walking is that the Overground can become extremely crowded during event days, and on the walk, there is always the possibility to meet and talk to other passionate fans or get involved with pregame events outside the stadium.
                          </p>
                          <p>Getting to and inside the stadium.
                          </p>
                          <p>When traveling as an international fan, I recommend arriving at least one hour before kickoff, as transport can sometimes be delayed. You might want to grab a bite to eat before the game and beat the queues that can build up when getting into the stadium. Once outside the stadium, you’ll see the iconic Tottenham High Road with various shops like Chick-King, where you’ll see long queues to taste their famous chicken takeaways. When you’re ready to head inside, make sure you locate the gate on your ticket and proceed accordingly. At the entrance, you'll have to go through security measures like a metal detector scan and bag check. Once finished with security, scan your ticket at the turnstile and enter the state-of-the-art Tottenham Stadium.
                          </p>
                          <p>Inside the stadium
                          </p>
                          <p>Once inside, you can find numerous state-of-the-art food and drink vendors that offer everything from pints to katsu curry plates. They have restaurants like The Linesman, N17 Grill, Katsu Korner, Smashed Olive, The Goal Line Bar, and The Chicken House. In addition, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is home to its own microbrewery found inside the stadium! Once situated with proper food and drink, you can make your way to your seat. When you find your seat, enjoy the exciting pre-match practice. There are also usually songs you can chant along with and the occasional legend doing interviews pitchside.
                          </p>
                          <p>Minutes before kickoff, you will find yourself cheering with fans, hearing the Star Wars opening theme as the players walk out, and finally losing your voice singing the iconic “When the Spurs Go Marching In” chant accompanied by the trumpet. Lastly, once kickoff starts, enjoy the game, pray for a win, and don’t forget to chant along!
                          </p>
                          <p>After the game:
                          </p>
                          <p>Depending on the vibes, you can stick around and sing and dance with other fans. However, after losses, the stadium is usually empty long before the final whistle as local fans try to beat queues and traffic on the way home. If you fancy a souvenir, you can always get in line for the official Spurs shop. Before heading back, make sure you snag a photo with the iconic Harry Kane mural and the Ledley King mural.
                          </p>
                          <p>Like before, you can either take the Overground back to Seven Sisters or walk back. Unfortunately, because everyone will be heading back at the same time, sometimes this process can take up to one hour.
                          </p>
                          <p>I hope my advice helps you out, and as always, COYS!!!
                          </p>
